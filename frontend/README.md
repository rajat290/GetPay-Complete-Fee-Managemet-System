 Phase‑1: Frontend Project Setup
Goal: Stable React environment ready ho

Create project using Vite + React

Install required dependencies:

axios → API calls ke liye

react-router-dom → routing

recharts → charts (admin analytics)

bootstrap/tailwind → responsive UI (decide karna hai)

Setup folder structure:

css
Copy
Edit
src/
  components/
  pages/
  context/
  services/
🔹 Phase‑2: Authentication (Login & Register)
Goal: Student, Admin, and Super Admin login flow

Create Login.jsx & Register.jsx pages

Use backend APIs such as `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/profile`, and invite/trial flows.

Auth now uses httpOnly backend cookies with a short-lived sessionStorage fallback for current-tab UX.

Create AuthContext for global auth state

Redirect based on role:

Admin → /admin

Student → /student

🔹 Phase‑3: Navigation & Routing
Goal: Proper navbar & protected routes

Navbar.jsx → dynamic links based on login & role

Create ProtectedRoute.jsx wrapper:

If logged in → allow access

Else → redirect to login

Routes:

/login

/trial

/admin

/student

/payment/:id

🔹 Phase‑4: Student Dashboard
Goal: Student fees management & payment

Show assigned fees list (fetch from /api/fees/assigned)

Status: Paid / Pending

Add Pay Now button → opens Razorpay Checkout

After payment success:

Update UI instantly

Show “Download Receipt” option

🔹 Phase‑5: Admin Dashboard
Goal: Fee creation, assignment & analytics

Create fee form → POST /api/fees/create

Assign fees to students → POST /api/fees/assign

Show fees list

Analytics Section:

Total fees collected

Pending payments

Defaulters

Charts using recharts

🔹 Phase‑6: Professional Features
Goal: Extra polish for production look

PDF Receipt Download (linking backend generated receipts)

Email Notifications UI (status shown to admin)

Loading Spinners & Error Handling

Responsive Navbar with buttons (Book Fee, View Fees, etc.)

🔹 Phase‑7: Final Testing & Deployment
Goal: Stable and sharable project

Test all flows in browser

Fix minor UI bugs

Deploy:

Frontend → Vercel (free)
